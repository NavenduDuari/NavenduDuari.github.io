## Introduction

Using tmux has been instrumental in streamlining my development workflow. While there might be a slight learning curve when starting out,
the benefits it offers far outweigh the initial effort. The enhanced productivity and efficiency gained through tmux make it a worthwhile investment for developers.

>tmux is a terminal multiplexer. It lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal, detach them (they keep running in the background) and reattach them to a different terminal.

## Why tmux?
Here are the reasons why I am a fan of tmux:

_Example tmux setup with multiple sessions, windows, and panes_

### Window and pane management
As a developer, using tmux empowers me by allowing me to have multiple windows and panes within a single terminal window. With this setup, I can simultaneously access and manage four codebases,
run four servers, and handle additional terminals for adhoc tasks. It provides the convenience of having everything consolidated in one screen, and I can effortlessly navigate to 
any desired location using a single keybinding.

### Session management
With tmux, the windows and panes within a session persist even if the internet connection is lost. This ensures that my setup remains intact and accessible for an extended period.
Whether I shut down my machine or accidentally close the setup, I can effortlessly restore the previous configuration as it is automatically saved within the tmux session.

### keybinding
tmux offers developer-friendly keybindings, which resemble the familiar and intuitive keybindings used in neovim.
As an avid neovim user, I find the tmux keybindings to be natural and seamlessly integrated into my workflow.

### Customization
tmux provides extensive customization options and a vibrant community ecosystem with a wide range of plugins.
This allows me to personalize the basic appearance, user interface, and keybindings according to my preferences

## Conclusion
Tmux has become an indispensable component of my workflow. Through this post, I aim to inspire readers to give tmux a try and experience its remarkable benefits. 
While customization details will be covered in a future post, this article serves as an introduction and motivation for embracing tmux as a valuable tool in their own development journey.
